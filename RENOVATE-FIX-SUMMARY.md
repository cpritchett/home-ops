# Renovate Permission Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Renovate Configuration Updated**
- Added `vulnerabilityAlerts: { enabled: true }` to `.renovaterc.json5`
- This should resolve the "Cannot access vulnerability alerts" error

✅ **Documentation Created**
- `docs/RENOVATE-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- Updated `README.md` with quick troubleshooting section

✅ **Diagnostic Tool Created**
- `scripts/fix-renovate-permissions.sh` - Interactive diagnostic script

## What You Need To Do Next

### 1. 🔑 Update GitHub App Permissions (REQUIRED)

**You must manually update your GitHub App permissions:**

1. Go to your GitHub App settings (where you created the Renovate bot)
2. Click "Edit" on your app
3. Scroll to "Repository permissions" and ensure these are set:
   - **Vulnerability alerts: Read** ← Most important for the "Cannot access vulnerability alerts" error
   - **Repository security events: Read**
   - **Packages: Read** ← Important for "Package lookup failures"
   - **Contents: Read**
   - **Metadata: Read** 
   - **Pull requests: Write**
4. **Save the permissions**
5. **Go to the "Install App" tab and reinstall/update the app on your repository**

### 2. 🛡️ Enable Repository Security Features

1. Go to your repository Settings → Security & analysis
2. Enable these if not already enabled:
   - **Dependency graph** ✅
   - **Dependabot alerts** ✅
   - **Dependabot security updates** (recommended)

### 3. 🧪 Test the Fixes

Run the diagnostic script to verify everything is working:

```bash
./scripts/fix-renovate-permissions.sh
```

This script will:
- Check that repository secrets are configured
- Verify the Renovate configuration is correct
- Guide you through permission verification
- Optionally trigger a test workflow run

### 4. 🔍 Monitor Results

After completing the above steps:

1. Wait for the next scheduled Renovate run (runs hourly)
2. Or trigger a manual run from GitHub Actions → Renovate workflow
3. Check the workflow logs for:
   - ✅ No more "Cannot access vulnerability alerts" warnings
   - ✅ No more "Package lookup failures" warnings
   - ✅ Successful dependency detection and PR creation

## Why These Changes Fix the Issues

### "Cannot access vulnerability alerts"
- **Root cause**: Renovate needs explicit permission to read vulnerability alerts
- **Fix**: Added `vulnerabilityAlerts: { enabled: true }` to configuration + GitHub App permissions

### "Package lookup failures" 
- **Root cause**: Missing GitHub App permissions for accessing package registries
- **Fix**: GitHub App permissions for "Packages: Read" access

## If Issues Persist

1. Check the detailed troubleshooting guide: `docs/RENOVATE-TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
2. Run the diagnostic script: `./scripts/fix-renovate-permissions.sh`
3. Verify the GitHub App is properly installed on the repository
4. Check that the private key in 1Password matches the GitHub App

## Success Indicators

You'll know the fix worked when:
- ✅ Renovate dashboard shows no permission warnings
- ✅ Workflow logs are clean (no WARN messages about alerts/packages)
- ✅ Dependency PRs are being created normally
- ✅ Vulnerability-based PRs appear when security issues are detected
